AZDA MISSION STATEMENT  \\nTo protect the health and safety of Arizona consumers, advance and support Arizona agriculture, and \\nsafeguard commerce.  \\nI.C.  BACKGROUND  \\nThe Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 authorized the United States Department of Agriculture \\n(USDA) to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops.  The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 \\n(Farm Bill) amended the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004.  Under the amended Act, the Secretary \\nof Agriculture is directed to make grants to States for each of the fiscal years 200 8 through 2012  to be used by \\nState departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops. The American Taxpayer \\nRelief Act of 2012 provided funding for fiscal year 2013 , section 10010 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 , Public \\nLaw 113 -79 provided  funding  for fiscal years 2014 thro ugh 2018 and section 10107 of the Agriculture \\nImprovement Act of 2018 , Public Law 115 -334 will provide funding for fiscal years 2019 through 2023.  \\nEnactment of a continuing resolution, appropriations act, or other authorizing leg islation may affect the \\navailability or level of funding for this program.  \\nI.D.  GRANT WRITING RESOURCES  \\nIf you have difficulty with this grant writing and application process, you are encouraged to seek help from an \\nappropriate resource.  There are several organizations and individuals who offer grant writing services for a \\nfee.  \\nI.E.  FUNDING SOURCE AN D AVAILABLE FUNDS  \\nAMS is charged with distributing block grant funds to state departments of agriculture, the District of \\nColumbia, the Comm onwealth of Puerto Rico , Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the \\nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops.  The \\nFY2024  Request for Applications published by AMS has announced the total am ount of  grant funds \\nAZDA  will receive . AZDA  projects that approximat ely $1,250,000.00  will be available for this  funding \\ncycle . AZDA  plans to make available for grants all of the funds appropriated to it under the SCBGP  this year \\nless AZDA ’s share for program administration  and other internal projects .  AZDA  may withhold up to eight  \\npercent for program administration.  Section 10107 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 , Public Law \\n115-334 and other COVID -19 stimulus legislation . Enactment of a con tinuing resolution, appropriations act, \\nor other authorizing legislation may affect the availability or level of funding for this program.  \\nAZDA  plans to  award multiple grants from these funds for the fiscal year 2024  grant  cycle.  The maximum \\ngrant request  shall  not exceed $10 0,000.00.  AZDA  may place a per application  cap on grant awards .  \\nUSDA, however, a s the funding source,  has the final approval over grant  projects.  Thus, while AZDA ’s Director \\nmakes the preliminary decisions based on AZDA  staff review and recommendations from a review panel of \\nindustry representatives, USDA will make the final decision concerning grant awards . \\nI.F.  QUARTERLY REIMBURSEM ENTS AND FUNDING ADV ANCES  \\nQuarterly reimbursement will be contingent upon compliance with guidelines s et forth by AZDA .  Each \\npayment is conditioned upon receipt and approval by the Program Coordinator of the Deliverable(s) specified \\nin the Scope of Work and shall be accompanied by reasonable assurance (documentation, receipts, invoices, \\netc.) that the goo ds and services for which payment is requested were actually received and performed.   \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n6 AZDA  has the right to disallow costs determined inappropriate or unreasonable.  The Program Coordinator \\nshall have a minimum of thirty (30) working days to approve the De liverable(s) and payment request forms.  \\nRequests for fund ing advances will be considered on a case by case basis.  If a funding advance is requested, \\nthe need for the advance must be clearly stated in the project proposal .  Advances will be limited to the \\nminimum amounts needed to meet cur rent disbursement needs and wi ll be scheduled so the funds are \\navailable as closely as  administratively possible to the actual expenditures by the grantee.  In addition, i nitial \\nfund ing advances shall not exceed 25 % of the  total grant award  and must be expended within 30 days of \\nreceipt .  \\nI.G.  ELIGIBLE APPLICAN TS \\nState and/or local organizations , government  entit ies, producer associations, academia, community based \\norganiza tions, and other specialty crop  stakeholders are eligible to apply either as single entities or in \\ncombined efforts.   Regional or multistate  projects may  be considered by AZDA .  SCBGP  grant funds will be \\nawarded for proj ects of up to 2 years  (24 months)  duration.   An entity may submit m ore than one \\napplication packet, but only if the application packets are for completely different projects.   If submitting \\nmultiple project application packets, please prioritize your submissions.     \\nI.H.  ELIGIBILITY REQUI REMENTS  \\nIn order to receive an award and enter into a Grant Award Agreement  with the AZDA , all applicants  must \\nprovide a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI ) number to the AZDA .  A UEI number is a twelve -digit number \\nestablished and assigned by SAM.gov  to uniquely identify business entities.  A UEI  number may be obtained \\nfrom  SAM.gov at:  https://gsa.gov/entityid . NOTE: If your entity is already registered in SAM.gov, your UEI \\nhas already been assigned.  Sign in to your SAM.gov account.  \\nI.I.  ELIGIBLE PRO JECTS  \\nTo be eligible for a grant, the project(s ) must enhance the competitiveness of U.S. or U.S. territory grown \\nspecialty crops in either domestic or foreign markets , including —(1) by leveraging efforts to market and \\npromote specialty  crops;(2) by assist ing producers with research and development  relevant to specialty \\ncrops;  (3) by expanding availability and access to specialty crops;  (4) by addressing local, regional, and \\nnational challenges  confronting specialty crop producers; and  (5) for such other purposes determined to be \\nappropriate  by the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with specialty  crop stakeholders and relevant \\nStat e departments of agriculture .  Projects must  benefit more than one commercial product  (e.g., ABC \\nCompany brand) , organi zation or individual . Project s must also b e able to perform one of the  national \\noutcomes and indicators  as described in Section II.D. and Appendix C. \\nAMS SCBGP  will not award grant funds for projects that solely benefit a particular commercial product or \\nprovide a profit to a single organization, institution, or individual. In addition, recipients and subrecipients \\ncannot use grant funds to compete unfairly with  private companies that provide equivalent products or \\nservices. Single organizations, institutions, and individuals are encouraged to participate as project partners.  \\n \\n \\n  \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n7 The following are some  examples of unacceptable and acceptable projects:  \\nExamples o f Unacceptable Projects  \\n\\uf0d8 A company requests grant funds to purchase starter plants or equipment used to plant, cultivate, and \\ngrow a specialty crop to make a profit, or to expand production of a single business or organization.  \\n\\uf0d8 A State requests grant fund s to make grants to individual specialty crop businesses or roadside stands to \\npromote their individual business.  \\n\\uf0d8 A non -profit organization uses grant funds to purchase produce and then sells  that produce to other \\nentities at cost or a higher price than t he purchase price while competing with other private companies \\nwho sell produce in the area  \\n\\uf0d8 A sole proprietor requests grant funds to redesign her/his logo in order to make her/his specialty crop \\nvalue -added product stand out at the local farmers’ market.   \\n\\uf0d8 A single specialty crop organization requests grant funds to market its organization so that it can increase \\nmembership in the organization.  \\nAccording to the USDA definition , bio-energy crops are not  considered Specialty Crops. Projects that support \\nbiobased products and bioenerg y and energy programs, including biofuels and other alternative uses for \\nagricultural and forestry commodities (development of biobased products) should see the USDA energy \\nwebsite at http://www.usda.g ov/energy/matrix/home  for information on how to submit those projects for \\nconsideration to the energy programs supported by USDA.  \\nExamples of Acceptable Projects  \\n\\uf0d8 A State requests funding to contract with a university to conduct research on the feasibility of planting, \\ncultivating, and growing a specialty crop in a particular area, the results of which will be shared with \\nmany growers throughout the State during the  project.  \\n\\uf0d8 A single grower requests funds to demonstrate the viability of organic small fruit production and \\npartners with Cooperative Extension to publicize the working model of diversification to other regional \\ngrowers.  \\n\\uf0d8 A single company requests funds t o provide a viable pollination alternative to specialty crop stakeholders \\nin a region that currently does not have one.  \\n\\uf0d8 A single non -profit organization requests funds to conduct an advertising campaign that will benefit their \\nspecialty crop members.  \\n\\uf0d8 A single farmer erects high tunnels on his/her property to extend the growing season of tomatoes and \\nlettuce and conducts a field day and farm tour to encourage other small family farmers to adopt the \\nproduction methods.  \\nAcceptable projects must also be  able to perform one of the national outcome s and indicators  as described in \\nSection II.D . and Appendix C. \\nExamples of enhancing the competitiveness of specialty crops include, but are not limited to:  \\n\\uf0b7 research  \\n\\uf0b7 promotion  \\n\\uf0b7 marketing  \\n\\uf0b7 nutrition  \\n\\uf0b7 trade enhanceme nt \\n\\uf0b7 food safety  \\n\\uf0b7 food security   \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n8 \\uf0b7 plant health programs  \\n\\uf0b7 education  \\n\\uf0b7 ‘‘buy local’’ programs  \\n\\uf0b7 increased consumption  \\n\\uf0b7 increased innovation  \\n\\uf0b7 improved efficiency and reduced  costs of distribution systems  \\n\\uf0b7 environme ntal concerns and conservation  \\n\\uf0b7 product development  \\n\\uf0b7 develop ing cooperatives  \\n \\nAMS encourages states to develop projects to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops pertaining to \\nthe following issues affecting the specialty crop industry:  \\n\\uf0b7 increasing child and adult nutrition knowledge and consumption of speci alty crops;  \\n\\uf0b7 participation of industry representatives at meetings of international standard setting bodies in \\nwhich the U.S. government participates;  \\n\\uf0b7 improving efficiency and reducing costs of distribution systems;  \\n\\uf0b7 assisting all entities in the specialty crop distribution chain in developing “Good Agricultural \\nPractices”, “Good Handling Practices”, “Good Manufacturing Practices”, and in cost -share \\narrangements for funding audits of such systems for small farmers, pac kers and processors;  \\n\\uf0b7 investing in specialty crop research, including organic research to focus on conservation and \\nenvironmental outcomes;  \\n\\uf0b7 enhancing food safety;  \\n\\uf0b7 developing new and improved seed varieties and specialty crops;  \\n\\uf0b7 pest and disease control;  \\n\\uf0b7 and sustainability.  \\nThe following types of projects may not necessarily be precluded  from SCBGP  funding. However, there are \\nother funding opportunities that may be more appropriate.  \\nThe Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI) is an alternative funding program for projects to support \\nresearch and extension that address key challenges of national, regional, and multi -state importance in \\nsustaining all components of food and agricultur e, including conventional and organic food production \\nsystems.

GRANT AWARDS AND REP ORTING  \\nIII.A. SCREENING PROCESS  \\nAt least three  AZDA  staff will screen  the application packets  and previous reporting compliance according to \\nthe Screening Criteria  below.  Only application packets  that  adequately address the criteria  listed below  will \\nreceive further consideration for an award.    \\nApplication Packet Screening Criteria  \\n1. Eligible Specialty Crop  \\nIs/are the commodity(s) deriving benefit from the grant eligible under the USDA -AMS “Definition of \\nSpecialty Crops”?  \\n2. Application Cover Sheet  \\nIs the cover sheet completed in the fillable PDF form?  \\nDoes the cover sheet include the specialty  crops deriving benefit from the grant?  \\nDoes the cover sheet have an authorized signature?  \\nIs the cover sheet no more than one page?  \\nIs the  amount requested  $100,000.00  or less ? \\n3. Project Profile  \\nIs the project profile  completed in the fillable PDF form?  \\nDoes the project profile include all required  sections?   \\nIs the project period no more than 2 years (24 months) duration?  \\n4. Reporting Compliance  \\nIs the project being led by an individual who has complied with the Grant Award Agreement \\nrequirements of previous SCBGP  project(s),  if applicable,  including reporting requirements?   \\n5. General Compliance with Instructions Provided  \\nDid the applicant comply with the instructions provided throughout this grant manual?  \\n6. General Compliance with Criteria described in section III.B on page 16.  \\nDoes the project meet all four criteria: (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) ? \\n   \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n16 III.B. APPLICATION PACKET  EVALUATION PROCESS  \\nUpon completion of the screening proc ess described in section III.A.  all remaining application packets will be \\nevaluated by the SCBGP  Evaluation Team .  The Evaluation Team will be made up of at least three  individuals \\nwith the appropriate background and expertise necessary to evaluate project proposals.    \\nThe Evaluation Team will first assess to what extent the proposed project : \\n(i) enhances the competitiveness  of the specialty crop (s) benefiting from the project;   \\n(ii) clearly defines a challenge  that is facing today’s Specialty Crop industry or a lack of \\neducation  about and/or acces s to specialty crops  and indicates a project that  assist s in \\nfinding a solution ; \\n(iii) includes well justified and appropriate budget information ; and   \\n(iv) is feasible.  \\nBased on these four  criteria, the Evaluation Team will determine which projects will receive recommendation  \\nfor funding.  Neither the Evaluation Team, nor AZDA  is required to recommend funding a project that does \\nnot sufficiently satisfy these four  criteria even if there are  enough remaining grant funds to do so.  \\nIII.C. APPLICATION P ACKET EVALUATION RAT ING CRITERIA  \\nFor those application packets not eliminated by  the screening process  in III.A. and  not recommended for \\nfunding by the evaluation process in  III.B.,  the Evaluatio n Team will use the criteria listed below to rate the \\napplication packets and make recommendations for funding to the AZDA  Director.      \\nWEIGHT  CRITERIA  RATING  \\n40% To what extent will the proposed project enhance the \\ncompetitiveness of the specialty crop(s) benefiting from this \\nproject?  0 to 5 with 0 being the lowest \\nand 5 being the highest  \\n35% To what extent does the proposal clearly define a challenge \\nthat is facing today’s Specialty Crop industry and indicate a \\nproject that assists  in finding a so lution?   0 to 5 with 0 being the lowest \\nand 5 being the highest  \\n25% Does the budget align with the activities of the project and \\nonly contain necessary costs?  0 to 5 with 0 being the lowest \\nand 5 being the highest  \\nThe SCBGP  Evaluation Team may adjust an application packet’s project proposal, scope of work and/or \\nproject budget. The Evaluation Team may disallow certain expenses in the best interest of the SCBGP and the \\nState.  \\nAZDA  may ask a potential grantee for more information on any of the above Application Packet Requirements \\nbefore awarding the grant or entering into an agreement with the grantee.  AZDA  reserves the right to fund \\nthe project in part, add and delete tasks, and ask for clarification on the work plan, timeline, and budget.  No \\nagreement will be entered into until AZDA  is satisfied with all the specifications of the project.  Any project \\nproposal funding is dependent upon the availability of federal funds and final  approval from the USDA.   \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n17 III.D. NOTIFICATION  OF AWARD  \\nAll eligible proposals will be reviewed.  Successful proposals will be chosen on the merits of the project as \\nthey relate to the published criteria and will be included in the Arizona State Plan , which will be submitted to \\nAMS.  Applicants will be notified in writing whether or not  their project is selected for inclusion in the Arizona \\nState Plan.  Funding is not guaranteed if the project is included in the State Plan.  Following a pproval of  the \\nArizona State Plan by AMS, applicants will be notified and sent a Grant Award Agreement to sign.  AZDA  \\nanticipates that grant awards and notification s will be made in late 2024.  \\nPlease do not call AZDA  to check on the status of an  application packet.    \\nAfter grant awards have been made, all application packets and the associated evaluations will be made \\navailable to the public.  If the applicant believe s that any of t he information contained in the  application \\npacket should be held confidential  pursua nt to State or Federal law , the applicant  must designate that \\ninform ation as “confidential” in the application packet and identify the applicable law . AZDA  may determine \\nthat trade secrets or proprietary i nformation may or may not continue to be held confidential.       \\nIII.E. REPORTING AWARDS  AND EXECUTIVE COMPEN SATION  \\nAZDA  must repor t each action that obligates $30 ,000 or more in SCBGP  funds for a grant to an entity, which is \\ndefined in 2 C.F.R.  § 25, subpart C , to http://www.fsrs.gov  in accordance with the Federal Funding \\nAccountability and Transparency Act ( FFATA ). \\nAdditionally, AZDA  must report the names and total compensation of a grantee’s five most highly \\ncompensated executives for the grantee’s preceding completed fiscal year if , but only if,  (i) the grantee \\nreceived $25 million or more in annual gross revenues and 80% or more of its a nnual gross revenues from \\nfederal procurement contracts and certain federal financial assistance  during the preceding fiscal year and \\n(ii) the public does not have access to information about the  compensation of the executives through SEC \\nreports.  Grantee s meeting these conditions must provide the required information to AZDA  when they \\nexecute a Grant Award Agreement.  \\nIII.F. GRANT  AWARD AGREEMENT AND PAYMENT  \\nPrior to  receiving funding, successful applicants will be required , as applicable,  to provide a UEI  number  \\n(section I.H .), proof of registration with and partic ipation in e -verify ( section I.W .), and evidence  of lawful \\npresence (section I.X .).  They will also be required to  sign a Grant Award Agreement with the AZDA  indicating \\ntheir intention to complete the proposed tasks and authorizing AZDA  to monitor the progress of the proposed \\nproject.  The Grant Award Agreement will include  provisions identified in sections I. K. – I.X. as well as \\nreporting requirements.    \\nGran t Award Agreements must be signed and returned to AZDA  within 30 days of receipt.  Failure to submit \\nan executed copy of the Grant Award Agreement within 30 days of receipt will result in the loss of \\nawarded grant funds , unless the delay was caused by circ umstances outside the control of the grantee.  \\nGrant Award Agreements may be  up to two years in duration depending on the type of project.  AZDA  staff \\nwill write the  grant award agreem ent based on the information  provide d, so it is important that  the \\napplic ation packet  is completed carefully .   \\nRequests for fund ing advances will be considered on a case by case basis.  If a funding advance is requested, \\nthe need for the advance must be clearly stated in the project proposal.   Refer to section I.F. for  more de tails.     \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n18 III.G. REPORTING REQUIREM ENTS  \\n1.

The Grantee must obtain pre -approval from the Program \\nCoordinator before any funds are reallocated within the approved budget.   \\n3. Annual Oral Presentations  - The Grantee may be required to  make an annual oral presentation to AZDA  \\nstaff and other SCBGP  stakeholders as scheduled by the SCBGP  Coordinator.  \\n4. Final Performance Report - A final report must be submitted to AZDA  by the Grantee , via the eCivis \\nportal , no later than sixty (60 ) calendar days after the Agreement termination dat e.  Failure to submit \\ntimely final reports may result in the forfeiture of final payment  and may affect the screening \\nprocess  of future grant applications .  The final report must be approved by AZDA  and AMS.  AZDA  will \\nnot disburse final payment until all requirements of the Agreement have been fulfilled.  All remaining \\ngrant funds or outstanding grant funds must be reconciled.  The final narrative report shall address all \\npoints listed below  and be suitable for dissemination to the public .   \\nThe general information and template required for  the Final Performance Report (subject to change by AMS \\nguidance) is provided in Appendix F. \\nIII.H. AMENDMENTS  \\nGrant Award Agreements shall only be modified by mutual written consent through a Grant Award \\nAgreement Amendment executed by AZDA  and the Grantee.  Unauthorized changes to Grant Award \\nAgreements shall be void and without effect, and the Grantee shall not be entitled to any claim under thi s \\nAgreement based on those changes.   \\nHTTP://AGRICULTURE.A Z.GOV  \\n19 Grant Award Agreements are intended to incorporate all provisions required by federal law.  If the \\nDepartment learns that a provision required by federal law has not been incorporated in the Agreement, the \\nparties agree to promptly amend the Agreement to include the provision.  \\nBudget Adjustments  – If a project budget adjustment is needed during the project period, a request may be \\nmade to AZDA , via the eCivis portal,  to reallocate budget funds between budget categories.   However, the total \\nbudget amount as dictated by the approved grant award cannot be adjusted  except as provided in section III.I.  \\nNo d eviation from the approved budget will be allowed without prior approval by the Program \\nCoordinator .  \\nUnexpended Funds  – Grantees shall  inform  AZDA  of the potential for unexpended awarded grant funds as \\nsoon as the grantee is aware  of the potential for unexpended funds , but no later than  90 days prior to the \\naward expiration date . Failure to expend budge ted funds may affec t the screening process  of future \\ngrant applications.  \\nIII.I. DISTRIBUTION OF UNEXPENDED AWARDE D FUNDS   \\nUnexpended awarded funds refer to awarded grant funds that grantees do not spend either because a grantee \\ncompleted its project under budget or a grantee did not complete all aspects of the project covered by the \\ngrant award agreement.  AZDA  reserves the r ight to use unexpended awarded funds to provide additional \\ngrant funds to other grantees who have current grant award agreements for projects covered by those \\nagreements or to provide initial funding to applicants who had previously applied for funding but  had not \\nbeen awarded a grant due to lack of available funds.  The Director will document in writing the specific \\njustifications for any distributions of unexpended awarded funds made under this section.
